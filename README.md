# MLFlow snippets

Rather than using versions of mlflow set up by others, I thought I'd take a few minutes and set up my own version without using any custom/proprietary utils to get a taste for how the tool works on a smaller scale and how it can be used to track model training on a smaller-than-enterprise scale. While here is stock, it has a number of useful examples to communicate its usefulness to colleagues.

Results were successful, expect to see autologging coming to various physics modules as time allows for development.
